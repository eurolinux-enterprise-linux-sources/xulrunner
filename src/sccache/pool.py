class AdaptivePool(object):
    '''
    Generic job pool handler. Subclasses define QUEUE_CLASS and PROCESS_CLASS
    which provide specific Queue and Process/Thread implementations.

    A pool is created like the following:
        def handler(data):
            result = do_something_with(data)
            yield result
        pool = AdaptivePoolSubclass(handler)

    Jobs are initiated with:
        pool.add_job(data)

    This dispatches the job data to an idle process/thread which then executes
    the handler with that data as argument. If no idle process/thread is found,
    a new one is spawned (hence the pool being adaptive).

    Results are either yielded or returned in a list from the handler. Using
    yield allows to keep the process/thread busy doing something else after
    having returned a result.

    Pool users may read results with the following (preferably in a separate
    thread):
        for result in pool.results():
            do_something_with(result)

    The pool itself, when it receives a job with add_job dispatches it to a
    dedicated control thread that is responsible for tracking jobs and
    processes/threads. The control thread then dispatches to processes/threads
    through the job_queue.

    Processes/threads are spawned with the AdaptivePoolWorker function, which
    conveniently wraps the handler. AdaptivePoolWorker handles communications
    with the control thread through the control queue, and sends results to the
    result queue, which is read from the results() iterator.
