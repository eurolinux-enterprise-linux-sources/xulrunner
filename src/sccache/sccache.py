# sccache is a ccache-like tool. It is used as a compiler wrapper and
# avoids compilation when possible, storing a cache in a remote storage.
#
# It works as a client-server. The client spawns a server if one is not
# running already, and sends the wrapped command line as a request to the
# server, which then does the work and returns stdout/stderr for the job.
# The client-server model allows the server to be more efficient in its
# handling of the remote storage.
